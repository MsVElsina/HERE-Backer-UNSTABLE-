# HE_REloaded for (UE 5.0)
Name subject to change, 
This is my modified version of the Free Horror Engine Asset for Unreal
The goal of this project is to expand and improve the amazing HorrorEngine Asset

The original HE asset was Developed by tansuergene

This is the unstable nonfeature complete WIP version
This build will be missing features will have more broken code than the official but will recive more regulart updates and is exclusive to the KOFI and Patreon backers

Currently this build is missing features that where present in the last Public build.
This is due to bugs intriduced with those features causing greater instability 
I am working on rebuilding these features with more focus on stability and optimization
